      <p>
	Before we can derive many intrinsic properties of a galaxy (luminosity, stellar mass, etc.), we first need to know how far away it is from us. This is most often derived using a galaxy's measured redshift (z), which we can convert to a physical distance based on our current understanding of cosmology. While deriving redshifts from spectroscopy is straightforward, obtaining good spectra is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, in order to study the evolution of hundreds of millions of galaxies collected in modern surveys, astronomers are forced to rely on ''photometric redshifts'' derived solely from multi-band imaging data. Obtaining accurate photometric redshifts are crucial for ongoing/future wide-field surveys (e.g., <a href="http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/">HSC</a>, <a href="http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">DES</a>, <a href="http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/">KiDS</a>, <a href="http://www.euclid-ec.org/">Euclid</a>, <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">LSST</a>, <a href="http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WFIRST</a>), which depend heavily on them to reach their target science goals.
      </p>
      <p>
	My work on photometric redshifts focuses on developing quick yet robust probabilistic approaches for conducting joint redshift inference between unknown individual objects and their parent (sub)populations using pre-existing spectroscopic datasets. As these data are often [1] heterogeneously populated, [2] sparsely sampled, [3] heavily biased, and [4] randomly censored, this represents a significant challenge for both machine learning and statistical modeling.

      <p>
	Deriving the underlying physical properties of an observed galaxy requires sophisticated modeling of its <a href="http://coolwiki.ipac.caltech.edu/index.php/SED_plots">spectral energy distribution</a> (SED). Most often, astronomers fit synthetic model spectra derived from <a href="http://www.sedfitting.org/SED08/Models.html">stellar evolution models</a> to either an observed spectrum or collection of broadband photometry. By fitting spectra derived from a variety of underlying parameters (star formation history, metallicity, dust content, etc.), we are able infer constraints of these parameters based on the observed data. <a href="http://www.sedfitting.org/SED08/Welcome.html">Currently available SED fitting methods</a>, however, have had difficulty keeping pace with the increasing quantity and quality of data from large surveys. In particular, most are not able to incorporate complementary constraints from photometric data, (sub)population-level information, and intrinsic variability in physical properties.
      </p>
      <p>
	I am involved with efforts within <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home/">Charlie Conroy</a>'s group to develop a more rigorous, Bayesian-oriented approach to SED fitting (<a href="https://github.com/bd-j/prospector">Prospector</a>). This work involves developing tools to simultaneously model spectroscopic and photometric data, flux calibration uncertainties, and correlated noise/priors. I am also working on leveraging spatial correlations present in integral field spectroscopic data to better model <a href="http://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/">SDSS-IV MaNGA</a> spectra.
