      <p>
	Before we can derive almost any physical properties of a galaxy (stellar mass, luminosity, intrinsic color, etc.), we first need to how far away it is from us. This is most often derived using it's measured redshift (z), which we can convert to a physical distance based on our current understanding of cosmology. While deriving redshifts from spectroscopy is straightforward, obtaining good spectra is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, in order to study the evolution of hundreds of millions of galaxies over cosmic time, astronomers are forced to rely on ''photometric redshifts'' derived solely from multi-band imaging data. Obtaining accurate photometric redshifts are crucial for ongoing/future wide-field surveys (e.g., <a href="http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/">HSC</a>, <a href="http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">DES</a>, <a href="http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/">KiDS</a>, <a href="http://www.euclid-ec.org/">Euclid</a>, <a href="https://www.lsst.org/">LSST</a>, <a href="http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/">WFIRST</a>), which depend heavily on them to reach their target science goals.

	My work on photometric redshifts focuses on developing quick yet robust probabilistic approaches for conducting joint redshift inference between unknown individual objects and their parent (sub)populations using existing spectroscopic datasets. As these spectroscopic data are often [1] heterogeneously populated, [2] sparsely sampled, [3] heavily baised, and [4] randomly censored, this represents a significant challenge for both machine learning and statistical modeling approaches. This is further complicated by the fact that photometric redshift probability distribution functions (PDFs) are <a href="https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter4/4_3_1_mixed.php">mixed distributions</a> (i.e. individual stars are all nearby while galaxies can be at a wide range of distances) that require joint modeling of the unknown object class (star, galaxy, quasar, etc.).

      <p>
	Deriving the physical properties of a galaxy requires sophisticated modeling of its <a href="http://coolwiki.ipac.caltech.edu/index.php/SED_plots">spectral energy distribution</a> (SED). This is most often done by fitting synthetic model spectra derived from <a href="http://www.sedfitting.org/SED08/Models.html">stellar evolution models</a> to either an observed spectrum or collection of broadband photometry. By fitting spectra derived from a variety of underlying parameters (star formation history, metallicity, dust content, etc.), we are able infer constraints of these parameters based on the observed data. <a href="http://www.sedfitting.org/SED08/Welcome.html">Currently available SED methods</a> have had difficulty keeping pace with the increasing quantity and quality of data from large surveys. In particular, most are not able to incorporate complementary constraints from photometric data, (sub)population-level information, and observed emission line variation.

	I am involved with efforts in <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy/home/">Charlie Conroy</a>'s group to develop a more rigorous, Bayesian-oriented approach to SED fitting. This work involves developing tools to simultaneously model spectroscopic and photometric data, flux calibration uncertainties, correlated noise (under)estimates, and model-dependent emission line amplitude variation with more flexible stellar models. I am also working on leveraging the spatial correlations present in integral field spectroscopic data to better model <a href="http://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/">SDSS-IV MaNGA</a> data.
